### Sharing a Job with PyLadies PDX

Have a job listing, CFP, or other opportunity you want to share with PyLadies PDX? Send it to Ariel Spear ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArielSpear)).

### Using This Project in Portland

To create the weekly PyLadies PDX Job Update,
* copy the template
* choose three job listings to share, using the local Python employers and remote Python employers lists also in this repo.
* research each company and share at least two links about the company. Share what the company does, how it is funded, and any information that will help PyLadies decide whether to apply.
* choose three other opportunities, like CFPs or local events, that are relevant to PyLadies.
* choose one article about job-hunting to share.

PLEASE USE THE SAME FORMAT FOR EACH WEEK.
ONLY SHARE JOBS FROM COMPANIES ALREADY ON OUR LIST.

Want to include a job listing for a company not listed in either the local Python employers or remote Python employers lists? Check with Thursday Bram about adding that company to the list.
